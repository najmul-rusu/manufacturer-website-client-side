            What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?

              <b>
                There are four main types of state you need to properly manage
                in your React apps:
              </b> <br />
              1. Local state <br />
              2. Global state <br />
              3. Server state <br />
              4. URL state

            What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure.

            <p>
              1. Keeping component state local where necessary. <br />
              2. Memoizing React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders. <br />
              3. Code-splitting in React using dynamic import() <br />
              4. Windowing or list virtualization in React. <br />
              5. Lazy loading images in React.

            How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </h2>
            <p>
            The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

              Why you do not set the state directly in React?
            </h2> 
            <p>
              <b>One should never update the state directly because of the following reasons:</b> <br />
              1. If you update it directly, calling the setState() afterward may just replace the update you made. <br />
              2. When you directly update the state, it does not change this.state immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and accessing it after calling this method will only return the present value. <br />
              3. You will lose control of the state across all components.
